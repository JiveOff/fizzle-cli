# Fizzle

(This is a **WIP** project, so it is not ready for use yet)

A **WIP** Command Line utility to start local servers under the \*.local domains using Docker, Traefik and mDNS (multi-cast DNS). It supports both HTTP and HTTPS.

## What it does

Fizzle creates a Traefik container that acts as a reverse proxy for your local servers. The CLI will also generate a local certificate for you and configure Traefik to use it.

Traefik will then launch a global entrypoint on port 80 and 443. It will then listen for requests on the registered \*.local domains and route them to the correct container.

The mDNS daemon is then launched to listen for DNS requests for the \*.local domains and route them to your local machine on your network if they are registered (in your Fizzle Traefik docker network).

## Output Example

`npx fizzle start` anywhere on your machine to:

- Create your local certificate
- Start Traefik
- Start the mDNS daemon

```bash
